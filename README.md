# Jurix: AI Courtroom Simulation

Jurix is an interactive AI-driven courtroom simulation platform designed to mimic real-world legal proceedings. It allows users to upload cases, evidence, and documents, and then simulates courtroom interactions with AI agents representing Prosecutor, Defense, and Judge roles. This tool is ideal for law students, educators, and legal professionals to practice arguments and study courtroom dynamics in a safe and controlled environment.

## Features

### AI Agents for Courtroom Roles:

- **ProsecutorAgent**: Generates prosecutorial arguments using legal datasets.
- **DefenseAgent**: Formulates defense strategies and counter-arguments.
- **JudgeAgent**: Evaluates arguments, maintains courtroom flow, and renders verdicts.

### Evidence Parsing:

- Upload PDFs, DOCX, images, or text documents.
- AI-powered parser converts evidence into structured summaries.
- Users can review, approve, or edit parsed evidence before simulation.

### Legal Knowledge Base:

- Supports IPC, CrPC, Constitution, and other Indian legal frameworks.
- Agents leverage structured datasets for reasoning.

### Simulation Workflow:

- Upload case files and evidence.
- AI parses and summarizes evidence.
- Start courtroom simulation with interactive AI agents.
- Receive detailed case summary including arguments, counterarguments, and verdict.

### Multi-Tier Fallback AI:

- **Primary**: Local custom-trained legal model.
- **Secondary**: Pre-trained open models.
- **Tertiary**: OpenAI / Gemini API integration for enhanced reasoning.

### Frontend & Backend:

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Flask (Python) with JSON/MongoDB for data storage.
